- 👋 Hi, I’m @jchickneas
- 👀 I have over 26 years experience developing engineering software using C/C++ and C#.  I have background in Building Information Modeling (BIM), engineering and construction.  I am interested also in parametric modeling and geometry, architecture and design in general as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Personally, I enjoy learning and playing electric bass guitar.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to up my game with node.js, TypeScript, and DevOps.
- 💞️ Not really looking to collaborate on anything at the moment b/c my schedule is quite busy, but, welcome any thoughful discussion.
